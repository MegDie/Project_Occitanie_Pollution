Widget
===========================

Implementation
---------------------------

In the `\interactive_notebook` folder, you can find a interactive notebook Widget report.

The goal of this notebook is to provide widgets that will compare, using boxplot/violins, the level of pollution across at least 3 cities from the dataset.

The interactive widgets allow you to choose month and particles or month and cities too see boxplot showing level of pollution for ozone or others particles.
The module ipywidgets has the iteract function that allow using interactity especially in boxplots.
