# Overview

The motivation of this project is to perform some data visualization blending time and space representation of a dataset of Occitanie pollution.

The ultimate goal for this project is to make a video of the O3 (ozone) level across time for the cities available in the dataset.

**Widget :** 
A widget will compare, using boxplot/violins, the level of pollution across at least 3 cities from the dataset.

**Map rendering :**
A synthetic map display the degree of pollution in the cities provided. 

**Harmonization :**
Analysis jointly of the data from Montpellier and Paris (Paris 13ème)




# Structure

  + In the `\beamer` folder, you will find soon a presentation of this work

  + The `\report` folder contains a jupyter notebook to display different elements like widgets and soon data visualization by interactive histrograms

  + The report `\occpolution` will contain a package python showing widgets and interactive maps showing polution data of Occitanie
