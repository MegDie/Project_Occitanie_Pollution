Occitanie: pollution analysis

The motivation of this project is to perform some data visualization blending time and space representation of the dataset http://data-atmo-occitanie.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4a648b54876f485e92f22e2ad5a5da32_0.

Some help on the statistics part could be found at http://josephsalmon.eu/enseignement/Montpellier/HMMA307/ANOVA.ipynb.

Video
The ultimate goal for this project is to make a video of the O3 (ozone) level across time for the cities available in the dataset.

Widget
Provide a widget that will compare, using boxplot/violins, the level of pollution across at least 3 cities from the dataset.

Map rendering
Show a synthetic map displaying the degree of pollution in the cities provided. You will for instance use circle showing the severity of the pollution following the guidelines from https://nordicesmhub.github.io/deep_python/14-publish/index.html, "Instead of Marker, you can use Circle" (for instance).

Harmonization
Analyze jointly the data from Montpellier and Paris (Paris 13Ã¨me), the later being available here: https://www.airparif.asso.fr/en/telechargement/telechargement-station

Remark: due to the nature of this project, the emphasize will be on the visualization and the quality of the produced video/images.
